Turn on your location detection settings and check out places near you to check in! Search for places near you based on 5 categories, viz. Fun, Education, Event, Food & Nightlife. Alternatively, view all the categories together by selective 'All'. Tap on a map pin to view more details about the location, along wtih an image. You can also view the weather information of that location, and few details like how far it is from you current location and the address of the location. Use the hamburger menu to expand/ collpase the list of all locations. To find a particular location by name instead, type at least 2 characters in the input field.
